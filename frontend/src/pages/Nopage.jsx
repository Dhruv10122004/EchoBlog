// This component is a placeholder for pages that do not exist.
// It simply displays a "404 Not Found!" message when rendered.
// It can be used in a React Router setup to handle unmatched routes.
// This is useful for providing a user-friendly message when a user navigates to a route that does not correspond to any existing component or page.
// It can be included in the routing configuration to catch all unmatched routes, ensuring that users receive a clear indication that the page they are looking for does not exist.
// It can be styled further to match the application's design or to provide additional navigation options, such as a link back to the home page or a search bar.
// This component does not require any props or state management, as it is a static message.
// It can be imported and used in the main application file or within a specific routing setup to handle 404 errors gracefully.
